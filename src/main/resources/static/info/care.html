        <div class="care-title">How to Care for Your Pet (Dogs & Cats)</div>
        <div class="care-lead">Proper care is essential for your pet's health, happiness, and longevity. Whether you have a dog or a cat, following these guidelines will help ensure your furry friend thrives in your home.</div>
        <ul class="care-list">
          <li><strong>Provide Nutritious Food:</strong> Feed your pet high-quality, species-appropriate food. Dogs and cats have different dietary needsâ€”choose food that matches their age, size, and health condition.</li>
          <li><strong>Fresh Water Always:</strong> Ensure your pet has access to clean, fresh water at all times to keep them hydrated and healthy.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Exercise:</strong> Dogs need daily walks and playtime. Cats benefit from interactive toys and climbing structures to stay active and prevent obesity.</li>
          <li><strong>Routine Veterinary Care:</strong> Schedule regular check-ups, vaccinations, and parasite prevention for both dogs and cats. Early detection of health issues is key.</li>
          <li><strong>Grooming and Hygiene:</strong> Brush your pet's coat regularly, trim nails, and maintain dental hygiene. Cats often groom themselves, but may still need help with brushing and nail care.</li>
          <li><strong>Safe and Comfortable Environment:</strong> Provide a cozy bed, safe toys, and a secure living space. Cats appreciate scratching posts and quiet resting spots.</li>
          <li><strong>Socialization and Attention:</strong> Spend quality time with your pet. Dogs need training and socialization; cats enjoy gentle play and affection.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect Their Nature:</strong> Understand the unique behaviors and needs of dogs and cats. Give them space when needed and never punish harshly.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="care-tip">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Every pet is unique. Observe your dog or cat's preferences and health, and consult your veterinarian for personalized care advice.
