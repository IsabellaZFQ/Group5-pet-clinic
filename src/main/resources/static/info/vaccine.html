        <div class="vaccine-lead">Vaccinating your pet is a fundamental responsibility for every caring owner. Vaccines not only prevent many deadly diseases but also protect the health of your pet and your family.</div>
        <ul class="vaccine-list">
          <li><strong>Prevents Infectious Diseases:</strong> Vaccines effectively protect against distemper, parvovirus, feline panleukopenia, rabies, and other life-threatening illnesses.</li>
          <li><strong>Protects Family Health:</strong> Some diseases, such as rabies, are zoonotic. Vaccination reduces the risk of transmission to humans.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduces Medical Costs:</strong> Prevention is better than cure. The cost of vaccination is much lower than the cost of treating serious diseases.</li>
          <li><strong>Promotes Socialization:</strong> Vaccinated pets are safer to take outdoors and interact with other animals, reducing the risk of cross-infection.</li>
          <li><strong>Extends Pet's Lifespan:</strong> A strong immune barrier keeps your pet healthy and allows them to accompany you longer.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="vaccine-tip">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Please follow your veterinarian's advice and vaccinate your pet on schedule. Keep a complete vaccination record for lifelong protection.
